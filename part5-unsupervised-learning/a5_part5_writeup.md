# Part 5 - Unsupervised Learning Writeup

After completing `a6_part5.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. Develop a name for each customer group based on the information from the graph. For example, one group might be called “Frugal” while another might be called “Shopaholic.” Explain your reasoning for each label.

There is a frugal group which has low annual income, therefore they spend less and have a smaller spending score.
There would be also a group opposite to frugal where despite having a low income, they are the "huge spenders."
There is a group that has a high salary, but doesn't spend much, the "strategical savers."
There is also the group that has a high salary, and therefore can spend a lot, "Appropriate spenders."
A group with a medium income but spends a lot is the "Shopaholics"
The group with a medium income but spends little is the "Savings" group. 
This shows that the amount of money you earn is not directly correlated to how much you shop.

2. What group would a customer who has a medium income and low spending habits be in?

A customer with a medium income would be in the in the "Savings" group.

3. Choose one cluster of interest to you. How might the marketing team approach this specific customer group?

A cluster that is interesting is the people who spend a lot of money despite having a small income. These people are either the ones who have to live up to high taxes, a lot of family to support, or it could be the people that would like to be preceived as rich. A marketing team could target the "perceiving to be rich ones" by enlisting products that look expensive but are not too expensive in reality.
